> [!IMPORTANT]
> Version 2 finally emerged after two years devoted to my family, marking a return to the project after an extended period away. An update of Suricata introduced breaking changes in the detection mechanism; version 2 addresses these changes while further enhancing the detection of suspicious network flows.
> You can see changes between the V1 and the V2 in this [PR description](https://github.com/SpyGuard/SpyGuard/pull/60).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Version 3** brings a major upgrade to the CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) layer, significantly raising SpyGuard's ability to detect advanced commercial spyware such as Pegasus, Predator, and Candiru:
>
> - **Composite scoring** — detection signals are now weighted and accumulated; a record's threat level upgrades automatically when enough signals converge (Low → Moderate at 4.0 pts, Moderate → High at 8.0 pts).
> - **JA3/JA4 fingerprint matching** (T2) — TLS client fingerprints are matched against known-malicious hashes, with a score of 5.0 pts each.
> - **MISP auto-sync** (T3) — MISP instances are polled on a configurable schedule; each sync is recorded in an audit log. JA3 fingerprint attributes are now ingested.
> - **Post-exposure quarantine** (T4) — after a known CTI publication (e.g. Amnesty Tech report), an operator can declare a quarantine window via the admin API; detection thresholds are hardened during that window (Moderate at 2.5 pts, High at 6.0 pts) to surface rebuilt infrastructure.
> - **Structural TLS signals** (T5) — two new IOC-list-independent signals: `tls_no_sni` (TLS without SNI extension, score 3.0) and `direct_ip_no_dns` (TLS to an IP with no prior DNS resolution seen, score 2.5).
> - **Domain mimicry heuristic** (T6) — detects fake news/media domains used by spyware operators (e.g. `kazakhtimes.com`, `presssaudi.io`) by matching a media keyword against a geo-political term in the second-level domain label (score 3.0).
> - **MVT/Amnesty STIX2 integration** (T7) — the watchers daemon now fetches and ingests all 16 STIX2 IOC bundles from the [mvt-indicators](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt-indicators) index (Pegasus, Predator, Candiru, Operation Triangulation, NoviSpy, ECHAP stalkerware, and more), refreshed every 24 hours.


### Description 

SpyGuard's main objective is to detect signs of compromise by monitoring network flows transmitted by a device. 

As it uses WiFi, SpyGuard can be used against a wide range of devices, such as smartphones, laptops, IOTs or workstations. To do its job, the analysis engine of SpyGuard is using Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), anomaly detection and is supported by [Suricata](https://suricata.io).

### Examples of use cases

|  📰 Journalists   |     🏦 IT Services      |  🌏 NGOs | 👩 Women's Shelter | 👮‍♂️ LEA |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| As a journalist, I need to test my smartphone's against spyware before or during engagements with confidential informants. |  Working for a public institution, I aim to set up a self-service kiosk where individuals can check their smartphones for spyware. | After traveling overseas, I'm looking to check my phone and laptop quickly. | I seek to examine the smartphones of women upon their arrival for any stalkerware. | I aim to check the communications of a smartphone in response to a complaint, as a preliminary step before proceeding with a full forensic analysis. |

**Note:** *SpyGuard is not a forensic tool*. Therefore, it might miss malware that does not communicate during the analysis. [Please refer to the FAQ for more information](https://github.com/SpyGuard/SpyGuard/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#1-spyguard-hasnt-detected-anything-malicious-im-safe).

### Installation

You need a debian-like operating system to install it easly by using the provided bash script. Once you've cloned the repository, just launch `install.sh` as root. Here are the command lines to do that:

```
cd /tmp/ && git clone https://github.com/SpyGuard/spyguard
cd spyguard && sudo bash install.sh
```

Once installed, you can go to the backend interface located at `https://localhost:8443` to manage the device and setup the right network interfaces to get it working. Please look at the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/SpyGuard/spyguard/wiki/Installing-SpyGuard) to get some tips regarding it.

> [!WARNING]
> Please check prior the installation that your Linux distribution is using `nmcli` to manage networks. Old Raspberry Pi operating systems require activation of nmcli the `raspi-config` interface prior Spyguard installation ([See here](https://github.com/SpyGuard/spyguard/wiki/Installing-SpyGuard#common-issues)).

The frontend is available at the URL `https://localhost:8000`.

### Smartphone analysis best practices 

* Do the interception in a public place (library, restaurant, train station...) or common place (office, home...); 
* Intercept the network communications of the device for at least 30 minutes; 
* Interact with the analysed device during the interception (reboot it, take a photo, send an SMS...);

### SpyGuard and Stalkerware threat

The indicators of compromise (IOCs) linked to stalkerware are now fully managed by [ECHAP](https://echap.eu.org), a French association working against cyberviolence. Even though stalkerware still remains a threat, **remember that most of digital violence and surveillance is done by using simple means**, such as hacking cloud & mail accounts. Therefore, we encourage you to consult the [ECHAP guides](https://echap.eu.org/ressources/) and apply their advice to your digital life alongside of device checks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is worth mentioning that the IOCs are distributed under the **Creative Common BY-NC-SA** licence.
> This imply a **non commercial use** of them. Please respect this licence and ask ECHAP for any question related to that.

### Commercial use

You can use SpyGuard in a commercial product. However, you can't use SpyGuard as the name of your product and you’re still required to follow the terms and conditions that the Apache License imposes, like refering to the SpyGuard project in customer documentation.
